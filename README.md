## dependencies

You'll need some more dependencies to create builds.

See the `electron-builder` wiki page: [Multi Platform Build](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build)

On linux you'll need a few more deps:

```
sudo apt-get install icnsutils graphicsmagick
```
